1. Introduction
The Bus Routes Problem is a classic  application of graph search techniques used in Artificial Intelligence and algorithm design. The goal is to determine the minimum number of buses required to travel from a given source bus stop to a target bus stop. Each bus route is represented as a circular path containing several stops, and a traveler may transfer between buses at any common stop.
This problem models real-world public transportation navigation and demonstrates how Breadth-First Search (BFS) can be used to compute shortest-path solutions in unweighted graphs.
2. Theory: Breadth‑First Search (BFS)
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next level.
Why  we used BFS :
Each bus ride represents a uniform cost.
Transfers between buses represent graph edges.
BFS guarantees the minimum number of bus transfers.
BFS in this context:
Nodes → Bus stops
Edges → Reaching new stops through a bus route
Cost → Number of bus routes used
Because all "edges" have equal weight, BFS is optimal for solving this type of transportation shortest-path problem.
3. Objectives
To represent bus routes and stops as a graph.
To implement an efficient BFS algorithm to compute the minimum number of buses needed to travel from source to target.
To create a mapping between stops and buses to enable fast traversal.
To determine when the destination is unreachable.
To develop practical understanding of BFS and real-world graph modeling.


4. Algorithm
Algorithm: Minimum Bus Transfers (BFS-Based Solver)
Check Trivial Case: If source == target, return 0.
Build Stop-to-Bus Map: Create a dictionary where each stop maps to all buses passing through it.
Initialize BFS:
Start queue with (source_stop, 0 buses_taken)
Maintain two visited sets:
visited_buses → Avoid reboarding same bus
visited_stops → Avoid revisiting stops
BFS Traversal:
Pop a stop from queue
Explore all buses that go through this stop
For each unvisited bus:
Mark the bus as visited
Traverse all stops that this bus can reach
If a stop == target → return buses_taken + 1
Else enqueue the stop with incremented bus count
If queue empties without reaching target: Return -1 (destination unreachable)

5. Implementation (Python Code)
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def numBusesToDestination(self, routes, source, target):
        if source == target:
            return 0
        stop_to_buses = {}
        for bus_index in range(len(routes)):
            route = routes[bus_index]
            for stop in route:
                if stop not in stop_to_buses:
                    stop_to_buses[stop] = []
                stop_to_buses[stop].append(bus_index)

        queue = deque()
        queue.append((source, 0))
        visited_buses = set()
        visited_stops = set([source])

        while queue:
            stop, buses_taken = queue.popleft()
            if stop not in stop_to_buses:
                continue
            for bus_index in stop_to_buses[stop]:
                if bus_index in visited_buses:
                    continue
                visited_buses.add(bus_index)
                for next_stop in routes[bus_index]:
                    if next_stop == target:
                        return buses_taken + 1
                    if next_stop not in visited_stops:
                        visited_stops.add(next_stop)
                        queue.append((next_stop, buses_taken + 1))
        return -1

# Now create input and call the function:
routes = [[1,2,7], [3,6,7]]
source = 1
target = 6

sol = Solution()
print(sol.numBusesToDestination(routes, source, target))  # <-- should print 2

6. Sample Input and Output
Input:
routes = [[1,2,7], [3,6,7]]
source = 1
target = 6
Output:
2
8. Conclusion
In this work, the BFS algorithm was successfully applied to determine the minimum number of bus transfers required to travel between two stops. The problem was modeled as a graph where stops and bus routes form interconnected nodes. BFS proved optimal for this unweighted shortest‑path scenario
BFS is effective for transportation network problems.
Mapping entities (stops → buses) is crucial for fast traversal.
Python data structures such as dictionaries, sets, and queues enable efficient state exploration.
The implementation correctly solves the problem and handles all critical cases, reinforcing BFS as a robust method for route optimization problems.
